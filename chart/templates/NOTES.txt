Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

To learn more about the release, try:

  $ helm status {{ .Release.Name }}
  $ helm get all {{ .Release.Name }}

{{- if .Values.ingress.enabled }}
You can access Logfire at:
  - Frontend: http{{ if .Values.ingress.tls }}s{{ end }}://{{ .Values.ingress.frontendHostname }}
  - API: http{{ if .Values.ingress.tls }}s{{ end }}://{{ .Values.ingress.apiHostname }}
{{- else }}
Logfire is not exposed through an ingress. To access the application, you can:

1. Port-forward the frontend service:
   kubectl port-forward svc/logfire-frontend 3000:3000 -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

2. Port-forward the backend service:
   kubectl port-forward svc/logfire-backend 8000:8000 -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

Then access:
  - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
  - API: http://localhost:8000
{{- end }}

Or set up your own Ingress / tunneling to these services.

{{- if .Values.dev.deployPostgres }}

{{- else }}

{{- end }}
